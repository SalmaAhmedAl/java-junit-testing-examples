# Java JUnit Testing Examples 🚀

This repository contains practical and clean examples of unit testing in Java using **JUnit 5**.  
It covers real-world testing across all common layers:

- ✅ Business Logic Layer
- ✅ Controller Layer (REST API)
- ✅ Data Access Layer (Repositories)
- ✅ Spike

---

## 📌 Why This Repo?

- Learn how to write clean, meaningful unit tests
- Understand test structure and coverage strategy
- Use mocking frameworks (like Mockito) effectively
- Spike new ideas with test-first thinking
Also, Writing good tests is just as important as writing good code.
